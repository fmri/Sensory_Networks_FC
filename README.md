This repository contains code for preprocessing, analysing, and making figures for the spacetime network project. 

Running most of this code requires access to the data folder which is available on SCC (/projectnb/somerslab/tom/projects/spacetime_network/data/).

Organization:
- Main directory: contains key scripts for file i/o and organization, file conversion, and preprocessing
- analysis: contains scripts for analysis of preprocessed data
- archive_code: old scripts/functions no longer used/useful
- functions: key functions used by scripts
- plotting_scripts: scripts used to plot information or analysis results
