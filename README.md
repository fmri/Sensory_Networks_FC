This repository contains code for preprocessing, analysing, and making figures for the spacetime network project. 

Running most of this code requires access to the data folder which is available on SCC (/projectnb/somerslab/tom/projects/spacetime_network/data/).

Organization:
- scripts: contains key scripts for file i/o and organization, file conversion, and preprocessing
- conn_analysis: contains scripts for analysis of data preprocessed using Conn
- fs_analysis_results: contains results of analysis of data preprocessed using freesurfer
- archive_code: old scripts/functions no longer used/useful
- functions: key functions used by scripts
- scripts: all analysis, plotting, ROI-related, preprocessing and other scripts
