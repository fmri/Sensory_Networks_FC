This repository contains code for preprocessing, analysing, and making figures for the sensory networks functional connectivity project. 

Running most of this code requires access to the data folder which is available on SCC (/projectnb/somerslab/tom/projects/sensory_networks_FC/data/).

Organization:
- scripts: contains key scripts for file i/o and organization, file conversion, preprocessing, ROI creation, and analysis
- archive_code: old scripts/functions no longer used/useful
- functions: key functions used by scripts
